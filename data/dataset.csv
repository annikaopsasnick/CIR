It's a twist on the classic gin martini that simply changes up the ratio of the two ingredients. If you enjoy vermouth, you'll find this a nice change of pace and a far cry from the modern custom of using virtually no vermouth. Use the best gin and vermouth you can get for this cocktail and add a dash of bitters for a little extra spark. Likewise, many of the standard martini options will also work here. For instance, shake it if you prefer or pour vodka. You might also enjoy it served with a lemon twist rather than the olive.

If you're looking for an old-school drink that really shows off the true flavor of absinthe, it's the recipe you need!

This recipe is very similar in taste and effect as the traditional method of drinking absinthe, which uses a sugar cube and absinthe spoon. In an interesting twist, bartenders of Thomas' time must have thought that absinthe wasn't enough anise for this drink. The recipe doubles up on that distinct flavor--reminiscent of black licorice--by adding a couple dashes of anisette.

The story goes that it was created in 1984 by U.K. bartender Dick Bradsell and it has been enjoyed by many drinkers ever since. It's also a drink that is open to interpretation, so it's okay if you don't have the exact ingredients in the recipe. The feature of this enhanced gin sour is the creme de mure, a blackberry liqueur. Though it is not a common bar ingredient, it is nice to have around for drinks such as this. If you have access to a good crop of blackberries, you might even try to make your own. It's as easy as adding the berries to a standard homemade liqueur recipe. While the Bramble is a fantastic cocktail, it is completely different than the drink known as the Bramble Bar, which has a scotch base. Both make fantastic summertime drinks, and they're quite nice to serve together, so both your whiskey and gin loving guests are satisfied. The Bramble may have a short history, but that doesn't mean that it hasn't been adapted many times. Some recipes will suggest a London dry gin while others opt for the fruitier Plymouth Gin. You will also find recipes that use either lemon or lime juice. If you do switch to lemon juice, use a lemon wheel for the garnish. Admittedly, creme de mure is not the easiest liqueur to find, though it is not impossible. If you're having no luck, there are a few options available. Blackberry Brandy: Many fruit-flavored brandies made today have some amount of sugar added to them, which makes them more of a liqueur than a true brandy. That is quite convenient because it makes blackberry brandy a viable substitution for the Bramble's creme de mure.Black Raspberry Liqueur: Blackberries and black raspberries have a very similar flavor as do the liqueurs made from the fruits. This means that you can get away with using a black raspberry liqueur like the popular Chambord when making the Bramble.",https://www.thespruceeats.com/thmb/tU6NN4VIWzFJ1J1JncTLRPExxcQ=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Bramble-158290361-56a172383df78cf7726ab79b.jpg,"['1 1/2 ounces gin', '3/4 ounce fresh lime juice', '3/4 ounce simple syrup', '3/4 ounce creme de mure liqueur', 'Lime wheel and raspberries for garnish']",5

The Italian dressing is one of those keys, and since it's not found in most other Caesar recipes, it can easily be overlooked, but we don't recommend that.

Vermouth is a fortified wine flavored with botanicals and herbs, originally developed as a medicinal tonic. Italian vermouth is traditionally sweet and red in color, while the French vermouth used in the martini is dry and clear.

There is no trick to making green beer and it requires no special bartending skills. It is, quite simply, a light-colored beer that has a drop of green food coloring added to it. The flavor does not change, only the color. It should be noted that if you want to drink like a real Irishman and celebrate the Emerald Isle's heritage, nothing is more appropriate than a pint of Guinness or a shot of Irish whiskey. There is even a Green Beer Day if you need another reason to drink green beer. Green Beer Day is a day-long party where celebrants drink beer dyed green.

Biographical books like Hemingway's own ""A Moveable Feast"" include countless tales of sharing drinks with literary friends while in Paris and much of his free time throughout his life was spent in bars. He was quite selective about what he imbibed and certainly had his preferences. After spending some time in Cuba, Hemingway quickly became enamored with the daiquiri. In 1921 Constantino Ribailagua, of El Floridita in Havana, created this variation in honor of his daiquiri-loving regular. As far as the drink goes, you will enjoy this amplified daiquiri because it brings the sweetness of maraschino along with tart grapefruit into the classic rum-lime mix.

This classic rum cocktail is too much fun to pass up, especially on those hot days of summer. This is a drink with a great story and it all began in 1944 at Trader Vic's original location in Oakland, California. Victor Bergeron, one of the founders of the tiki cocktail culture, was very well known for his amazing rum cocktails. One day he mixed up a new drink using ""...17-year old Jamaican J. Wray Nephew rum, added fresh lime, some Orange Curacao from Holland, a dash of Rock Candy syrup, and a dollop of French Orgeat..."" with lime and mint and served it to a friend visiting from Tahiti. After that first drink, the Tahitian phrase ""Mai Tai - Roa Ae"" (""Out of this world - The best!"") was exclaimed and Bergeron had a name for his drink. Over the years, the Mai Tai recipe has changed greatly. The first recipe below is a close adaptation of Bergeron's 'original' recipe sourced from Beachbum Berry, a great resource for tiki cocktail history. Bergeron and other tiki bartenders were notorious for guarding their recipes against competitors. Over the years, their secrets slowly came out.

The spice (and a little sweetness) comes from a homemade chipotle syrup that takes less than an hour to make. That is backed up by an intriguing chocolate spirit which is not sweet like the typical chocolate liqueur. Instead, Mozart Chocolate Spirit has a dry, bittersweet profile--likened to chocolate vodka--with no sweetener added, which is why it's a ""spirit"" and not a ""liqueur."" It can easily become a new favorite in your bar. Behind all of that is a very nice rum from Flor de Cana. The brand makes two 4-year-old expressions, both of which are surprisingly dry as well.

The drink itself is a delightful, sophisticated mix that builds on the scotch-vermouth combination of the Rob Roy. The addition of absinthe brings in a nice contrasting flavor, though be sure to keep this accent to a dash, as it can easily overpower the drink. If absinthe is a bit too much for your taste, there is a variation called the Bobby Burns cocktail that you might find a bit more appealing.

The contrasting tastes are interesting and never cease to amaze those who enjoy these drinks. In the case of the Rocky Cucumber, 'hot pepper sauce' brings in the heat and that is a pretty broad ingredient. I used Cholula for my hot sauce because it's a personal favorite that I find useful in almost any spicy cocktail. Tabasco's bitterness and stronger heat would be another great option, though you could use almost any hot sauce you have in the pantry. Tip: Take it easy with the hot sauce!

The difference between the two is that the Shiso Mojito uses shiso in place of mint. Shiso, or perilla, is a herb in the mint family and is primarily used in Japanese cuisine. There are two types of shiso, red and green, with green being preferred in this recipe. It is a little difficult to describe, but you will find it does not have a mint flavor as we typically think of the herb, it is more of an anise, citrus, and cinnamon taste. Some people compare it (especially the red) to a light basil while some recipes suggest parsley as a substitute when shiso cannot be found. As shiso has become more popular in recent years, it is possible to find it in well-stocked grocers and stores that specialize in international cuisine. Beyond the shiso, this recipe can be adapted in a few ways. It pairs nicely with cachaca, though a quality light rum does a fine job as well. The key lime and yuzu juice add a nice tart aspect that makes it very interesting.

It's a sweet, frothy, warm drink that is flavored with dark rum and cognac and it has been a holiday favorite since the 1820s. There's no sugar-coating it: the Tom & Jerry is not the easiest drink to make, but it is worth it. While this drink is often compared to Eggnog, it is a completely different drink. The main difference is that the Tom & Jerry is served warm and the drink is built in the serving mug. Eggnog, on the other hand, is cold and already mixed and ready to drink. The Tom & Jerry is, however, a fantastic alternative to Eggnog and many drinkers prefer it because it is more of a warm milk punch and has less of an 'eggy' flavor. You will find that the Tom & Jerry is much like making a Hot Buttered Rum. It all begins with mixing the spiced batter, which can be refrigerated or frozen until it's time for a drink. At that point, it's as simple as pouring warm milk over your liquor and batter.

It's a fun name that has often been used for any heavily spiked, fruit-filled rum drink. This recipe is for the classic 1934 zombie punch, which was unearthed by Jeff ""Beachbum"" Berry. It comes from the private collection of Don (Beach) the Beachcomber, one of the founders of the tiki cocktail culture. Beach was a man known for guarding his recipes very well and Berry wrote about this one in his 2007 book ""Sippin' Safari."" You will notice that this is not a ""punch"" in the modern sense. Instead of a large batch made to serve many guests at a party, it is a classically-styled punch served by the glass. In this context, ""punch"" refers to a fruity cocktail that is filled with an array of flavors. The zombie punch is fascinating, with its combination of citrus, herbs, spices, and sweet grenadine. On top of all that, there are three different styles of rum!
